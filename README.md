# Truncated Color Cube
built over https://github.com/stackgl/bunny-walkthrough

This repository creates a truncated cube with [this
gist](https://gist.github.com/bvraghav/b897c168a67d08ad8f581009531afad2).

And thus visualisation is a representation of the RGB
color space.

## Usage

1. `git clone` using the URL/ command on the [github
   web
   page](https://github.com/bvraghav/truncatedColorCube).
2. Descend into the working directory.
3. Run the following on commandline.

```sh
npm install
npm run start
```

## The description from bunny-walkthrough

A "hello world" example of sorts for using [stack.gl](http://stack.gl/):
simply draws a 3D bunny to the screen with an orbit camera for interacting
with.

Thoroughly verbose comments here, to step through the basics of how everything
fits together in practice.

To run this locally, ensure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and
[git](http://git-scm.com/) installed, then run the following from your terminal:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:stackgl/bunny-walkthrough
cd bunny-walkthrough
npm install
npm start
```
